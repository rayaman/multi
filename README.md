# Multi Version: 15.1.0 LÃ–VR Integration
**Key Changes**
- Emulating system threading on a single thread
    - Purpose to allow consistant code that can scale when threading is available. Check out the changelog for more details
- Proper support for lua versions above 5.1 (More testing is needed, a full test suite is being developed and should be made available soon)

Found an issue? Please [submit it](https://github.com/rayaman/multi/issues) and I'll look into it!

My multitasking library for lua. It is a pure lua binding, with exceptions of the integrations and the love2d compat. If you find any bugs or have any issues, please [let me know](https://github.com/rayaman/multi/issues) and I'll look into it!.

INSTALLING
----------
Links to dependencies:
[lanes](https://github.com/LuaLanes/lanes)

To install copy the multi folder into your environment and you are good to go</br>
If you want to use the system threads, then you'll need to install lanes!
**or** use luarocks `luarocks install multi`

Going forward I will include a Release zip for love2d.
**The Network Manager rework is currently being worked on and the old version is not included in this version.**
